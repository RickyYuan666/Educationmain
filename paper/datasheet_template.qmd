3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?*
	- The dataset is simulated to represent a realistic sample of income distributions across gender, education levels, and career fields.

4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance consists of processed features, including:
        - `income`: Individual's total annual income.
        - `gender`: Coded as "Male" or "Female."
        - `education_level`: Highest level of education attained.
        - `career_field`: Field of study or employment, categorized as STEM, Humanities, or Health Sciences.
        - `age`: Age of the individual.
        - `race`: Coded as "White" or "Non-White."

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, the dependent variable is `income`, analyzed against gender, education level, and career field.

6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable).*
	- No, the dataset is complete.

7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
